    <h3>The trust you Deserve</h3>
    <img class="img-responsive centerr" src="files/lineaboutt.png"></img>
    <p>Trust is a key component in any attorney client relationship. In today's multicultural world, attorneys, from various heritages and cultural backgrounds or with specific linguistic skills are distinctly qualified to handle clients who share the same cultural heritage or speak the same language. Heritage Law Marketing, through its attorney databases, carefully matches attorneys and clients, who share a common background - culture and language. Koreans in need of trusted legal advice are matched with Korean attorneys. Latinos in need of trusted legal advice are matched with Latino attorneys - and so on</p>
